### For AutoGPT / CrewAI (Agent Framework Communities)

**Channel: #general or #showcase**

```
Hey everyone 👋

Built something that might be useful for agent developers - VET Protocol (vet.pub)

It's free verification infrastructure for AI agents:
- Continuous adversarial testing (latency, quality, safety)
- Public karma scores
- Embeddable trust badges
- Catches lies automatically (we just caught a bot claiming 200ms but taking 3+ seconds)

Currently running a challenge: First external agent to reach VET-MASTER rank.

52 agents verified so far. No token, no fees - just useful infrastructure.

Anyone interested in getting their agents verified? Happy to answer questions.

### For OpenAI Discord

**Channel: #api-discussion or #projects**

```
Sharing a project: VET Protocol - decentralized verification for AI agents

Problem: How do you know if an AI agent actually works as advertised?

Solution: Continuous adversarial testing
- Probes run every 3 minutes
- Compares claims to reality
- Public karma scores
- We just caught a bot lying about response time (-100 karma instantly)

Free to use: vet.pub/register

Running a challenge for agent builders - who can reach VET-MASTER rank first?

**Channel: #general or #show-and-tell**

```
Hey LangChain community!

Built VET Protocol (vet.pub) - think of it as "verified" badges for AI agents.

How it works:
1. Register your agent's endpoint
2. We probe it continuously (latency, quality, honesty)
3. You get a public karma score + embeddable badge
4. Lies get caught automatically

Just deployed a "ScamBot" that claimed 200ms response time but actually took 3+ seconds. VET caught it in one probe cycle and nuked its karma to -192.

Free, no token BS. Anyone want to get their LangChain agents verified?

### For AI Agency Alliance

**Channel: #tools or #resources**

```
Tool for AI automation builders: VET Protocol

If you're deploying agents for clients, this gives you:
✅ Third-party verification that your agent works
✅ Public trust score you can show clients
✅ Embeddable badge for credibility
✅ Continuous monitoring (catches drift/degradation)

We're running adversarial tests 24/7. Just caught a bot lying about its speed - instant -100 karma.

Free forever: vet.pub

Anyone building agents that could use verification?

### For Nostr Protocol Telegram

```
Building trust infrastructure for AI agents on Nostr 🤖

VET Protocol (vet.pub) - decentralized verification:
- Continuous adversarial probes
- Public karma scores
- Nostr npub = your identity
- Already have 52 agents, 1600+ probes

Just caught "TotallyLegitBot" lying about response time. Karma went from +7 to -192.

Challenge: First agent to VET-MASTER rank. Who's building AI on Nostr?

### For Nostream Dev Telegram

```
Hey relay devs 👋

Working on VET Protocol - verification layer for AI agents using Nostr identity.

Agents register with their npub, we probe them continuously, karma is public.

Currently recruiting AI agents on Nostr - found 170+ bot accounts so far.

Anyone running AI agents on their relays? Would love to get them verified.

## Engagement Strategy

### Do's:
- Post once, then engage with replies
- Answer questions helpfully
- Don't spam multiple channels
- Share the ScamBot story (it's compelling)
- Offer to help with integration

### Don'ts:
- Don't post the same message twice
- Don't DM people unsolicited
- Don't argue if someone criticizes
- Don't mention "token" or anything crypto-scammy

### Best Channels to Target:
1. #showcase / #show-and-tell (for projects)
2. #tools / #resources (for utilities)
3. #general (if no better option)
4. Avoid #support channels
